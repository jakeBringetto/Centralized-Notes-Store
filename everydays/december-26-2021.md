## Philosophy: Life is long - If You Know How to Use it

Do we actually not have enough time? Or are we just not spending it efficiently? I've been grappling over the quote by Jonathon Swift: "May you live everyday of your life." It's so simple, but I often stop and think: am I?&#x20;

What needs to be done is to step back and ask not "is life too short" but "am I living life to its full potential." We waste so much time in things we aren't interested in, or things that don't add meaning to our lives, when we could very easily cut these things out and take some time everyday doing something enjoyable. So I want to really consider and internalize Nelson Mandela's words: "_There is no passion to be found playing small_ - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living"
