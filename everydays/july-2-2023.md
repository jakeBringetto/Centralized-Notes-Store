## I am become death

Famous quote, I was curious about the grammar of this , especially the use of "am" in "am become". It seems in modern english the correct grammatical formation would be "I have become death." However, the word "am" used to be the way to form the present perfect tense with intransitive verbs, in this case "become." Oppenheimer quotes the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu scripture originally translated to english in 1785 from Sanskrit. During this time some speakers still used this form. Shakespeare often used this form, saying things like "I am come a light into the world." Though Oppenheimer likely choose this construction for the rhetorical power. Still many languages like Italian, German and French still use this form of "to be" to indicate present perfect tense and emphasize a change in state. Essentially, while this quotes probably sounds a bit weird to native modern english speakers, it is in fact correct and possibly even more rhetorically powerful.
