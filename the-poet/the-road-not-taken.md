# The Road not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,&#x20;

And sorry I could not travel both&#x20;

And be one traveler, long I stood&#x20;

And looked down one as far as I could&#x20;

To where it bent in the undergrowth;



Then took the other, as just as fair,&#x20;

And having perhaps the better claim,&#x20;

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;&#x20;

Though as for that the passing there&#x20;

Had worn them really about the same,



And both that morning equally lay&#x20;

In leaves no step had trodden black.&#x20;

Oh, I kept the first for another day!&#x20;

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,&#x20;

I doubted if I should ever come back.



I shall be telling this with a sigh&#x20;

Somewhere ages and ages hence:&#x20;

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—&#x20;

I took the one less traveled by,&#x20;

And that has made all the difference.



### Some things

Interestingly, Robert Frost made this poem as a joke to a friend who often was indecisive about "which" road to take. However, as Frost said, "I'm never more serious than when I'm joking."  I think that there are often misconceptions (if they even exist in interpretation) about this particular poem.  As discussed in my AP Literature class, people have a tendency to derive the meaning of this poem as "taking the road less traveled" or something along those lines. It may be interpreted as taking the road less travel has worked for the better, which is probably from the line "and that has made all the difference." But I refrain from saying Frost's tone in this poem really sets a joyous or even content mood. It really does seem the statement "and that has made all the difference" was a very literal statement -- the decision wasn't right nor wrong, but it clearly made the difference as decisions tend to do. So I think the poem has so more melancholic undertones, even if it is not meant to be a poem of sadness or regret. I think there is some frustration at the finiteness of this life, as Frost tells the story "with a sigh", in realization that we really only can walk the path we choose to walk. There is not room for infinite random walks in this universe. And Frost really reinforces this idea that choosing a path is something that you do and never revisit -- "I doubted if I should ever come back."  He even sets the poem up for this mood in the first stanza, observing that he is but "one traveler" who was "sorry that \[he] could not travel both \[paths]."

> Its triumph is that it _does_ travel two emotional trajectories while cohering as a single statement. We cannot tell, ultimately, whether the speaker is pleased with his choice; a sigh can be either contented or regretful. The speaker claims that his decision has made “all the difference,” but the word _difference_ itself conveys no sense of whether this choice made the speaker’s life better or worse—he could, perhaps, be envisioning an alternate version of life, one full of the imagined pleasures the _other_ road would have offered.&#x20;

I think that taking anything away from this poem is difficult -- not because it has no meaning, but because it's really difficult to know what meaning is right or productive, ya know. To me the ending seems to highlight or tendency to reflect on past decisions and even fabricate stories of what was and what could have been. I mean, it seems to be a pretty unimportant decision, yet he is telling it "somewhere ages and ages hence," -- note here the weird, archaic, fairytale like diction, yeah pretty odd. I know that I have the habit of this, often romanticizing the different paths of life, and getting stressed about the past. But I think there may be a note, or a semblance of at least, or optimism. Sort of an acceptance that what's happened already made all the difference, and that there may not be an objectively "better" path. The poem really isn't claiming that the result of a decision is good nor bad, but instead emphasizes the decision itself, claiming that this is what makes all the difference in our lives. Again, I don't know the exact takeaway of this conclusions -- it seems very obvious but still very convoluted.  It is hard to know how we should think about decisions. And it also brings my attention to the title. The main conclusion most people make when reading this poem is that the road less taken can potentially lead to greater reward. But the title refers to the path _not_ taken.  This is a battle I often face -- it's hard to not think about what could have been if we just took the other path. I think this is what Frost calls us to think about in this poem. Not the actual paths themselves, but the immense impact that making decisions has on our lives. It is so easy to get caught up in what could have been, but it is important to note that the decision already made the difference. Maybe in the future we'll make more well crafted decision, or maybe better yet, we'll stop doubting them and make the best of what's already been decided. I don't know.

I think my confusion might arise from that fact that Frost himself lays out two poems --  one of somebody congratulating themself for taking the less common path and one of dramatized regret for the path not taken. Again, I think this very confusion is a central theme of the poem. Decisions have a tendency to make us feel uneasy. In conclusions, stoicism.&#x20;
