# A Universe of Atoms, An Atom In The Universe

_There are the rushing waves_\
_mountains of molecules_\
_each stupidly minding its own business_\
_trillions apart_\
_yet forming white surf in unison_

Ages on ages\
before any eyes could see\
year after year\
thunderously pounding the shore as now.\
For whom, for what?\
On a dead planet\
with no life to entertain.

Never at rest\
tortured by energy\
wasted prodigiously by the Sun\
poured into space.\
A mite makes the sea roar.

Deep in the sea\
all molecules repeat\
the patterns of one another\
till complex new ones are formed.\
They make others like themselves\
and a new dance starts.\
Growing in size and complexity\
living things\
masses of atoms\
DNA, protein\
dancing a pattern ever more intricate.

Out of the cradle\
onto dry land\
here it is\
standing:\
atoms with consciousness;\
matter with curiosity.

Stands at the sea,\
wonders at wondering: I\
a universe of atoms\
an atom in the Universe.



### Analysis

Cosmic horror and the likes of it, consuming a mind consumed, peering into the misty sea at night, illuminated by moonlight, to wonder at wondering. Anecdotes of reality, or its bayesian estimate perhaps, and I, an atom, contemplate my significance. Thoughts of thoughts existing in a vacuum, created from nothing, about nothing, may be everything if our universe was from nothing and is everything. For it could be that we are the conscience of the universe, the soul of the cosmos. And to explore is to do it justice, for without us the universe is, but it isn't, as existence rests in conscience. And so, spatially we are insignificant, but we are the typical sequence in the asymptotic equipartition principle, defining the hyperspace in probability as a point in it. Thus, there is fulfillment in exploration, which can be done in life, and therefore fulfillment to be found in life. This is revolutionary - a universe of atoms, an atom in universe, atoms with consciousness, matter with curiosity.
