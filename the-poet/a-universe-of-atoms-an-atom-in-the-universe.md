# A Universe of Atoms, An Atom In The Universe

_There are the rushing waves_\
_mountains of molecules_\
_each stupidly minding its own business_\
_trillions apart_\
_yet forming white surf in unison_

Ages on ages\
before any eyes could see\
year after year\
thunderously pounding the shore as now.\
For whom, for what?\
On a dead planet\
with no life to entertain.

Never at rest\
tortured by energy\
wasted prodigiously by the Sun\
poured into space.\
A mite makes the sea roar.

Deep in the sea\
all molecules repeat\
the patterns of one another\
till complex new ones are formed.\
They make others like themselves\
and a new dance starts.\
Growing in size and complexity\
living things\
masses of atoms\
DNA, protein\
dancing a pattern ever more intricate.

Out of the cradle\
onto dry land\
here it is\
standing:\
atoms with consciousness;\
matter with curiosity.

Stands at the sea,\
wonders at wondering: I\
a universe of atoms\
an atom in the Universe.
