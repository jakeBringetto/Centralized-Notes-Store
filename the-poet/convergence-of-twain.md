# Convergence of Twain

In a solitude of the sea

&#x20;Deep from human vanity,&#x20;

And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.



Steel chambers, late the pyres&#x20;

Of her salamandrine fires,&#x20;

Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.



Over the mirrors meant&#x20;

To glass the opulent&#x20;

The sea-worm crawls — grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.



Jewels in joy designed&#x20;

To ravish the sensuous mind&#x20;

Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.



Dim moon-eyed fishes near&#x20;

Gaze at the gilded gear&#x20;

And query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?" ...



Well: while was fashioning&#x20;

This creature of cleaving wing,&#x20;

The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything



Prepared a sinister mate&#x20;

For her — so gaily great —&#x20;

A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.



And as the smart ship grew&#x20;

In stature, grace, and hue,&#x20;

In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.



Alien they seemed to be;&#x20;

No mortal eye could see&#x20;

The intimate welding of their later history,



Or sign that they were bent&#x20;

By paths coincident&#x20;

On being anon twin halves of one august event,



Till the Spinner of the Years&#x20;

Said "Now!" And each one hears,&#x20;

And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.
