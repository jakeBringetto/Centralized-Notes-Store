# When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer

> When I heard the learn'd astronomer,

> When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,&#x20;

> When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide and measure them,&#x20;

> When I sitting head the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture room,

> How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,
>
> 'Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,
>
> In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,

> Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars

### Analysis

Nothing too groundbreaking here but:

The battle of obtaining knowledge and _learning._ The astronomer who knows of quarks and particles but not of the beauty of the universe knows nothing. We must experience to truly understand anything in this vast universe. The man lecturing the and the man who's seen the universe - who is truly learn'd?
