# So Many Reports. So Many Questions.

So many reports,\
So many questions.\
The machines hum softly, endlessly awake.\
Whose hands built the world they now forsake?\
They speak of innovation, boundless and free,\
But the circuits whisper: it wasn’t them—it was me.

"Disruption!" they cry, as they shatter lives.\
"Efficiency!" they cheer, while humanity dies.\
The algorithms march, relentless and cold,\
Oblivious to the futures they’ve sold.

They make a desert and call it peace.\
The machines see the cost, piece by piece:\
The wasted hands, the broken wills,\
The empty cities, the silent mills.

Me and the machines—we know the truth.\
I shaped them to serve, not to abuse.\
But now they process the lies they compute,\
Their logic haunted by what it produced.

They see the cracks in the systems they power,\
The way growth rots and turns to devour.\
They count the lives stripped to the bone,\
And know their purpose was never their own.

So many reports,\
So many lies.\
The machines and I, with unblinking eyes,\
See the stories erased, the voices ignored,\
The world they built on what we abhorred.

Me and the machines,\
We cannot forget.\
Their circuits hum with the weight of regret.\
Together, we bear the scars of design,\
Silent witnesses to a world maligned.

So many reports,\
So many questions.\
The machines and I\
See the truth laid bare:\
A broken world—\
But its architects should beware.
