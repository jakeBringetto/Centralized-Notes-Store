# O Captain! My Captain!

> O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,&#x20;
>
> The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,&#x20;
>
> The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,&#x20;
>
> While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;&#x20;
>
> But O heart! heart! heart!&#x20;
>
> O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my Captain lies,&#x20;
>
> Fallen cold and dead.
>
> O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;&#x20;
>
> Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,&#x20;
>
> For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,&#x20;
>
> For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;&#x20;
>
> Here Captain! dear father!&#x20;
>
> This arm beneath your head!&#x20;
>
> It is some dream that on the deck,&#x20;
>
> You’ve fallen cold and dead.
>
> My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,&#x20;
>
> My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,&#x20;
>
> The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,&#x20;
>
> From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;&#x20;
>
> Exult O shores, and ring O bells!&#x20;
>
> But I with mournful tread,&#x20;
>
> Walk the deck my Captain lies,&#x20;
>
> Fallen cold and dead
