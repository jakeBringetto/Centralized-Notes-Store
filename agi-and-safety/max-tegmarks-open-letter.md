### Notes

* Philosophical question: Does eliminating some "struggle" make us less human?
  * The case for human existence and where we derive meaning
  * How does ai enhance or hinder "growing" as a human
    * Hopeful trajectory is that ai is an aid while we remain human, ai is supplemental to human flourishment in a way
    * Less hopeful trajectory is that we lose a lot of things that provide us with meaning
  * Consciousness is a fundamental element of what is means to be human
* Life 3.0
  * We already possess the ability to update our "software"
  * Life 3.0 is the idea of being able to replace our organic "hardware"
