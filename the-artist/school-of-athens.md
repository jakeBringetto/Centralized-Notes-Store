### Content

The work captures a scene - philosophers gather under a Roman arc to discuss the truth. The spacious hall is reminiscent of the "temples raised by philosophy" written by Lucretius (see "On the Nature of the Universe for more on Lucretius"). Our eye is brought by the linear perspective to the focal point, where we see philosophers Plato and Aristotle discussing Idealism vs. Realism. In fact, we see Plato pointing up to the world of forms, while Aristotle holds his hand to the ground. The two figures break the group into two sides: one side is representative of "Idealistic" thinkers, and the other showcases the realists. We see thinkers such as Pythagoras drawing geometric figures, Euclid, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Ptolemy, Michelangelo, and even Raphael himself.
