## meta-modern art

Metamodernism is "a romantic reaction to our crisis-ridden moment."  Between modernism's hubristic attempt to create a "better" society and post-modernism's sneer at this hubris exists metamodernism. It's more of a philosophy than a genre of art, but I think that it capture's the spirit of a beeple. Metamodernists often hold the same cynicism as the postmodernists, but share the modernist aspiration for a better society. The meta-modern artist often takes an ironic-serious take (which seem so be oxymoron, but alas). They cleverly craft works that seem to be ironic, but are so ironic that they are obviously serious, or obviously nonsensical - there is not hidden, flowery critique (although there is often critique).  Simply, it's post-ironic, a serious take cloaked in sarcasm.

Beeple's main project is the "everydays", which is a collection in which he creates a new digital artwork every day. These works are digital art, with a wide range of subject matter. They are usually characterized by smooth textures, vivid colors, realistic imagery, and eccentric subject matter. In recent days, he has shifted his style to include a lot of social and political commentary.

The discussion on whether this is metamodernism begins with defining beeple's goal. The art seems to be satirical, but it is so covered in sarcasm that it is clearly an attack on the subject. for example:&#x20;

This certainly seems to be satire, but it is so obvious that it's not some clever, subtle commentary. Yet, there seems to be a nuanced hint of reductio ad absurdum. By reducing matters to complete absurdum, there is an aspect of trying to better society through thoughtful reminder that the world is in a crazy place. It is our job to be enlightened to the ridiculous, which beeple does do. So, is this modernism? Is it post-modernism? Is it meta-modernism? Maybe, but it may also just be a bunch of expensive nonsense. However, I like to this of this as capturing whatever you call this emerging genre of post-ironic art. The genre that consists of internet memes, absurd digital art, and bizarre animations. It doesn't seem to fall under the category of "fine art", but it is definitely part of modern (or meta-modern if you will) culture. I like to think of people 100 years in the future, staring a class studying Da Vinci, and finishing with Beeple. But then again, their art is probably even more post-post-post-post-post-modern, so I'm sure they can handle it.

## NFTs and the Magnus Opus

Beeple not only marks a trend in modern culture, but also in technology.
