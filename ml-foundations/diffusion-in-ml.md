# Diffusion in ML

### Overview and Inspiration

The goal of a diffusion model is to be able to recover useful information from a noisy source. The idea is that if we can take something and systematically apply noise, we can learn how to reverse the process form a noisy source to reconstruct something of value. Interestingly, the inspiration actually comes from thermodynamics.
