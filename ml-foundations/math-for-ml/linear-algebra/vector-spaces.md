# Vector Spaces

## Definitions:

a vector space $$V$$ is a set in which:

* There exists an additive identity (written 0) in V such that x + 0 = x for all x ∈ V
* For each x ∈ V , there exists an additive inverse (written −x) such that x + (−x) = 0
* There exists a multiplicative identity (written 1) in R such that 1x = x for all x ∈ V
* Commutativity: x + y = y + x for all x, y ∈ V
* Associativity: (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) and α(βx) = (αβ)x for all x, y, z ∈ V and α, β ∈ R
* Distributivity: α(x + y) = αx + αy and (α + β)x = αx + βx for all x, y ∈ V and α, β ∈ R

The span of $$v_1$$, . . . , $$v_n$$ ∈ V is the set of all vectors that can be expressed of a linear combination of them: span{$$v_1$$, . . . , $$v_n$$} = {v ∈ V : ∃$$α_1$$, . . . , $$α_n$$ such that $$α_1v_1$$ + · · · + $$α_nv_n$$= v} If a set of vectors is linearly independent and its span is the whole of V , those vectors are said to be a basis for V . In fact, every linearly independent set of vectors forms a basis for its span. If a vector space is spanned by a finite number of vectors, it is said to be finite-dimensional. Otherwise it is infinite-dimensional. The number of vectors in a basis for a finite-dimensional vector space V is called the dimension of V and denoted dim V .
