# A year in the PNW

The days here don’t begin. They just leak into each other, like ink on wet paper. I moved to the Pacific Northwest thinking I would find something. I did not expect it to be absence. It didn’t happen all at once, the realization that I was waiting for something that would never come.

I left a life behind, and potentially some version of myself. And at the time this seemed intentional, that perhaps I could search for something that I was missing. I took a job in a new city.  A new opportunity to truly experience the profundity of existence. A job that offered progression. A life that was supposed to mean something. I thought that what I lacked in deep contentment I could replace with variance. A sudden twist in a stagnant plot.&#x20;

This will be the place where I find what I’m looking for.

But the days here don't begin. The clouds tether to concrete skyscapers begging for acceptance in a sea of green trees and learing mountains. The job is fine but empty. The days pass without landmarks. I write myself as the protagonist of my life, missing out on it. I start to look forward to the end of days that don't begin — the end of workdays, the end of months, the end of this phase of life. There is a certain weight to the gray, to the lack of profundity in the mundane.

I thought that if I stared hard enough at the city, it would speak to me. If I looked hard enough at my reflection, it would begin to look like someone I wanted to be. I thought if I stared hard enough at the city, it would tell me something.

I tried. I sat in coffee shops with a notebook open, filling pages with half-thoughts and stolen conversations. I watched raindrops race down bus windows like they were spelling out something important. I scrolled through philosophy forums at 2 AM, looking for a stranger who had figured out what I hadn't.

Nothing.

So I tried harder.

I read Kierkegaard, Camus, Nietzsche. I listened to lectures about absurdity, existence, the unbearable lightness of being. I copied lines down like scripture. I bound myself to quotes like scripture, trying to elevate ideas to a godlike sense of meaning. _Man is condemned to be free._ _There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide._ _We must imagine Sisyphus happy._

But I was **not** happy.

I devoured books, podcasts, theories—every idea that might explain why I was here, why I woke up every morning feeling like I was waiting for something that never arrived. I wanted to believe that I came here to live deliberately. I went outside and sat by the water. So desperately did I want to find meaning in the way the water swelled against the shore, or how the trees whisper in the wind, or how the sun shows itself between months of gray. I walked for miles without direction, waiting for the air to feel different, for the city to whisper something back.

It didn’t.&#x20;

I started writing feverishly, convinced that if I could just put the right words in the right order, something inside me would snap into place. But the words felt dead the moment they hit the page. I tore them out, threw them away, started again.

I thought I was on the edge of something, some great realization just out of reach.\
I thought if I just looked a little longer, tried a little harder, I would finally see it.

I was wrong.

And that was the worst part—the moment when I realized that **all the searching wasn’t leading anywhere.** That meaning wasn’t _waiting to be found._ That I could read every book, walk every street, listen to every genius who had ever lived, and still feel like I was standing at the edge of something that wasn’t there.

But I didn’t stop.\
Not yet.

Because the idea that there was **nothing** terrified me more than the exhaustion of searching.

So I kept looking.\
Kept listening.\
Kept hoping that somewhere, somehow, I had simply missed the answer.

I began to feel like I was slipping away. I wondered if my thoughts had slowly began to replace themselves while I didn't notice, and that I was no longer the same person. I looked back at a version of myself that still believe. Somewhere, this version of me exists. He feels the warmth of the light. I try to call out to him, but my voice is water, rippling through a sea of nothingness. I wonder if I am just a shadow of him. And I want to yell out — cherish the light! But my voice is like tears in rain, vanishing before reaching him. Was he ever real? Vices, stagnation, the fear of being _nothing._

At first, I thought I could push through it. That if I just kept moving, kept searching, kept reaching, eventually, something would catch. That meaning was just beyond my grasp, that all I needed was **one more realization, one more moment of clarity, one more reason to keep believing.**

But then something cracked. And when it did, there was nothing behind it.

I don’t know when it started—maybe it had been happening all along, slowly, like a hairline fracture widening under pressure. But at some point, **the weight of it all became unbearable.**

The searching. The waiting. The waking up and feeling like I had already lost before the day had begun.

One night, I sat in my apartment, staring at the ceiling, and I realized I had run out of questions.

**I had nothing left to ask.**\
**I had nothing left to chase.**\
**I had nothing left.**

And that terrified me more than anything.

Because at least when I was searching, at least when I was trying to make something out of all this, there was momentum. There was **hope,** even if it was buried under exhaustion. But now? Now there was just stillness.

And in that stillness, I felt something close to fear—**the kind of fear that doesn’t spike your heart rate, but slows it. The kind that doesn’t make you want to run, but makes you want to disappear.** To recede so far into the void that no one remembers me, especially myself.

The days started blurring together, not because they leaked into each other like before, but because they didn’t feel like anything at all.

I stopped reading.\
Stopped writing.\
Stopped believing the next day would be different from the last.

I let old vices creep back in, not because I wanted them, but because I **didn’t care enough to stop them.** I let myself dissolve into distractions, into empty routines, into nights spent awake for no reason at all.

I wasn’t _miserable._\
I wasn’t _suffering._\
I was just **absent.**

I would catch glimpses of myself in windows, in mirrors, in the reflection of my phone screen, and I wouldn’t recognize who was looking back. There was no spark. No hunger. No urgency.

And the worst part?

I didn’t even miss myself.

I wasn’t waiting for things to get better.\
I wasn’t waiting for a sign.\
I wasn’t waiting at all.

I was just **here.**

And for the first time, I wasn’t sure that was enough.

I don't know what changed, if anything did at all. Perhaps I ran out of ways to dissociate. Maybe, after enough time, the absence started to feel less like a void and more like space. Maybe I descended so far that there was nothing left for me but to look up at the sky.&#x20;

One morning, I stepped outside, and the city looked the same as it always had—gray sky, damp pavement, the distant hum of something always moving. I stood there, breathing in the cold air, and realized that for the first time in a long time, **I wasn’t thinking about what came next.**

I wasn’t searching.\
I wasn’t waiting.\
I wasn’t trying to make this moment mean anything.

I was just **in it.**

I tilted my head up. The sky was overcast, thick with clouds. There was no warmth, no golden light breaking through. And yet—

**I knew the sun was there.**

Behind the gray. Behind the weight. Behind everything I couldn’t see, everything I had lost, everything I had tried and failed to make sense of.

And maybe… **that was enough.**

That life was still happening, even when I couldn’t feel it.\
That I was still here, even when I didn’t recognize myself.\
That there was something beyond this—**even if I would never fully grasp it.**

Maybe meaning wasn’t something **found.**\
Maybe it wasn’t something **given.**\
Maybe it was something that just **was.**

Like the sun behind the clouds.

Like existence itself.

Like me.

For a long time, I searched for something profound.

I thought if I walked far enough, thought hard enough, became enough, I would find it—some hidden thread running beneath it all. I moved to a city where the sky never quite opened, where the rain came in whispers, where the mountains loomed quiet and indifferent. I worked a job that felt like waiting. I sat in coffee shops and watched my breath fog the glass, waiting for meaning to settle in my chest like the mist over the water.

But meaning never came. Not in the way I wanted.

Some days, I burned with the hunger to leave, to find something greater. Other days, I slipped through time like a ghost, untouched and unremembered. I spent too long looking toward the end of things, as if life could only matter in retrospect, as if I could not claim the present unless I could justify it.

But then, somewhere between the grey mornings and the endless waiting, I stopped searching.

Not because I had found the profound, but because I had stopped needing to.

One day, I stood outside, and the sun was hidden behind clouds. And yet, I knew it was there. And there was a whole life in that—**in knowing the sun was there, even when I couldn’t see it.**

Maybe the mistake was thinking life had to be profound to be real.\
Maybe it was enough that it _happened._

Maybe I did not need meaning to exist.

Maybe I just needed to exist.

And in that, I had already found everything.

I existed. I existed in the cold, in the stillness, in the quiet moments no one will remember. I existed in days that bled together, in nights that stretched too long, in the spaces between questions that never got answered. And maybe—**that has always been enough.**

The tree grows, it stretches, it stands through storms. And then one day, it falls. Maybe no one hears it. Maybe no one remembers it was ever there.

But does that mean it was meaningless?

The shade still cooled someone once.\
The roots still split the earth, made way for something new.\
The leaves still caught the wind, whispered to the world in ways no one ever recorded.

And maybe that’s all existence ever is—**not a grand, lasting monument, but a moment of impact, whether seen or unseen.**

Maybe it doesn’t matter if no one remembers.\
Maybe it only matters that, for some time, _you were here._

How do we know it was there?\
We don’t.

Not for certain. Not in a way that lasts.

But maybe that’s the wrong question. Maybe the question isn’t **“How do we know it was there?”** but **“Does it matter if we don’t?”**

If the tree was real—if it stood, if it reached, if it felt the sun—does it need to be remembered to have _been_?

Maybe existence isn’t about legacy. Maybe it isn’t about proof.\
Maybe it’s just about the fact that, for a while, **it happened.**

And maybe that’s enough.

Maybe that’s all it ever was.

Not about meaning.\
Not about permanence.\
Not about who saw, who remembered, who cared.

Just that it _happened._

A breath taken. A thought formed. A moment lived.

And if that’s true—if existence is nothing more than the fact that it **was**—then maybe we don’t need to chase something greater. Maybe we don’t need to fear being forgotten, or question whether it was worth it.

Because it _was._

And maybe that’s enough.

That’s it, my friend. Maybe the real exhaustion isn’t from the things themselves, but from **always waiting for them to be over.** Always looking ahead to the exit, to the conclusion, to the moment when it’ll feel _right_ to leave, to change, to move on.

But if you’re always waiting for things to end, then you’re never really _in_ them, are you? You’re always half-gone before they’re even finished.

Maybe the answer isn’t quitting.\
Maybe it isn’t staying.\
Maybe it’s **letting things happen while they’re happening.**

Not just enduring. Not just tolerating.\
But actually **being in them**—until you’re not.

And then, when the moment comes where leaving isn’t a question, but an inevitability—when it feels like stepping forward instead of just stepping _out_—you’ll know.

Not because you forced an ending.\
But because the story already turned the page.

I searched for meaning like it was something waiting to be found, something buried deep beneath the right book, the right thought, the right moment. But there was no great revelation, no final answer. There was only this: the days passed, the rain fell, and I was here. I existed—not brilliantly, not profoundly, not in some way that would be remembered. But I existed. And maybe, without needing it to be anything more, that was always enough.

Even if nothing changed. Even if no one noticed. Even if it never mattered the way I wanted it to—**I was here.** I lived inside the gray, inside the questions, inside the space between knowing and not knowing.

So tell me—**if you’ve ever woken up and felt the weight of the world pressing down on you, if you’ve ever searched for something you couldn’t name, if you’ve ever stood beneath a sky so thick with clouds that you thought the sun might be gone forever—tell me, do you feel it? Do you see it?**

Because the sun is still there. It has always been there.&#x20;

And so have you.
