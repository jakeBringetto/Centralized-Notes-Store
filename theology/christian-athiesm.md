# Christian Athiesm

### Basic Overview

At its core the idea behind Christian Atheism is an acceptance or appreciation for the teaching and events of the bible, but a rejection of any of the bible's theistic claims. This takes the form of appreciation for the ethics system, the history and cultural system, and even some more abstract views that I will describe below.

### The Systems

The simplest manifestation of this perspective is simply to disregard all theism but learn about what the bible says about ethics, culture, history, etc. Clearly, the bible delves into many different areas of ethics and how to live an ethical life. Although this isn't what makes a christian, morality is at the core of many verses and parables in the bible. Christian Atheists may look at the teachings of Jesus at face value, viewing them as examples of how to live a good life, and not ways to be more "god-like".  For example, in Mathew 10:15-20 Jesus tells a parable about the hear of a man:

> Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand. What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
>
> Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
>
> He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides.\[a] If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
>
> Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
>
> “Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them. “Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”

One could easily read this parable and derive meaning from it without beleiveing in a higher power at all. Many people enjoy reading parables for the wisdom they derive, more as a philosophical or academic exercise. I would classify this a the most simple and straight forward genre of Christian Athiesm. In fact, this really doesn't even express any beliefs and may not even deserve the title. It's more just an appreciation for the wisdom of the bible as any other literary text.

### Zizek and God's rejection of himself

There are more extreme version of Christian Athiesm that take it a step further and claim that Christianity is the actually a consistent version of Atheism. Zizek derives some inspiration from Chesterson's _Orthodoxy_, specifically the chapter "The Romance of Orthodoxy." In this chapter Chesterson highlights the moment on the cross where Jesus says, "My god, why have you forsaken me?"  Zizek interprets this as an actual rejection of god from god himself as jesus is the son of god and a part of the holy trinity. He claims that for a moment on the cross, god himself was an athiest, and in this way christianity is the only religion that mentions atheism. The impication is that Christianity is really about the absence of god. Even in the most critical situations, such as the death of his only son, god was not there. The bible then says that the humans should be the ones to spread the message until god revists one day. In this way god takes himself out of the picture and says, "you are one your own for now." This really says less about the existence of god and more about the philosophy of christianity and Zizek's belief that it actually is a form of athiesm. Part of being a christian is subscribing to the belief that god lives on in the people. In his words:

"The crucifixion is something absolutely unique because in that moment of, father, why have you abandoned me?, for a brief moment, symbolically, God himself becomes an atheist, in the sense of getting a gap there. That is something absolutely unique. It means you are not simply separated from God. Your separation from God is a part of divinity itself."
