# Christian Athiesm

### Basic Overview

At its core the idea behind Christian Atheism is an acceptance or appreciation for the teaching and events of the bible, but a rejection of any of the bible's theistic claims. This takes the form of appreciation for the ethics system, the history and cultural system, and even some more abstract views that I will describe below.

### The Systems

The simplest manifestation of this perspective is simply to disregard all theism but learn about what the bible says about ethics, culture, history, etc. Clearly, the bible delves into many different areas of ethics and how to live an ethical life. Although this isn't what makes a christian, morality is at the core of many verses and parables in the bible. Christian Atheists may look at the teachings of Jesus at face value, viewing them as examples of how to live a good life, and not ways to be more "god-like".  For example, in Mathew 10:15-20 Jesus tells a parable about the hear of a man:

> Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand. What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
>
> Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
>
> He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides.\[a] If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
>
> Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
>
> “Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them. “Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”

One could easily read this parable and derive meaning from it without beleiveing in a higher power at all. Many people enjoy reading parables for the wisdom they derive, more as a philosophical or academic exercise. I would classify this a the most simple and straight forward genre of Christian Athiesm. In fact, this really doesn't even express any beliefs and may not even deserve the title. It's more just an appreciation for the wisdom of the bible as any other literary text.
