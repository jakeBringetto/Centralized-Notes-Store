# Demons

### Demons in Math/Philosophy

Demons are commonly used in thought experiments in the philosophical community. They are typically proposed as special beings with abilities that allow them to accomplish specific tasks. It's often argued then, that the existence of these creatures imply to realization or contradiction, and in turn prove something about the world. As if to say, "even if this special creature designed to accomplish X can't do this thing, it surely is not this way in the actual world."&#x20;

#### Laplaces Demon

Perhaps the most famous of Demon-based thought experiments is Laplace's Demon. Laplace prompts us to imagine a demon that knows everything about the instantaneous physics of the present - the position of molecules, their velocities, acceleration, mass, charge, etc as well as all physical laws that define our universe. The question then becomes, with this knowledge, could the demon reconstruct the entire past and lay out the entire future of the universe. Ultimately, it is an argument that ponders the idea of causal determinism. Of course there are many arguments that attempt to counter this conclusion, such as the existence of many modern ideas in physics. This includes thermodynamic irreversibility and quantum mechanical irreversibility. With regards to the latter, a central argument is that Laplace's demon is incompatible with the Copenhagen interpretation, with theorizes that quantum systems are not reversible. Another interesting idea is to image the demon as a computer, with infinite processing power and storage obviously. Using cantor diagonalization, it can be argued that two of these devices can not predict each other. Essentially, the demon would have to exist externally with respect to our universe. However, our proposition requires that the demon exist in our world, with is a contradiction, and can be down using cantor diag. Side note, it's actually much simpler to assume free will exists and to make a similar argument using Turing machines.
