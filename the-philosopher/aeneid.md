# Aeneid

### Plot Summary



### Virgil and The Augustan Regime

A key question in Virgil's Aeneid is whether or not it is commentary on the Augustan Regime. Rome under Augustus was a powerful empire, so some speculate that Virgil was praising the Empire built under Augustus in his _Aeneid_. Some even create foil's between characters like Aeneus and the Emperor himself. However, as seen in Tacitus's _Agricola_, Rome was not a perfect place. As put by Tacitus when talking about Rome: "They plunder, they slaughter, and they steal: this they falsely name Empire, and where they make a wasteland, they call it peace." This notion expresses that Rome created an impressive Empire, but not without cost. This is a sentiment that I believe Virgil also expands upon in _Aeneid_.  __  My hypothesis is that Virgil really has two voices in his Epic: a public voice of praise and a private voice of regret. Virgil himself, being a native of a village conquered by Augustus, understands the tragedy of conquest. I think that throughout the Epic he reminds the reader of Rome's greatness, but begs them not to forget the price of "progress".&#x20;
