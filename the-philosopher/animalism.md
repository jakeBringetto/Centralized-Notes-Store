# Animalism

### Lockean Legacy

Jonny draws a sharp ahh distinction between the human animal and the person. His idea is that there is the classification of man as an animal - a living, breathing, complex arrangement of matter capable of sustaining life. On the other hand, there is the person, who is able of intelligent thought (however you define that...) -- reason, reflection, knowledge of the self as the self, etc.&#x20;

> as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that _Person_

&#x20;A large motivation for this discussion around the time of Locke is the resurrection problem - On the resurrection day, what gets resurrected, the physical matter of the body that has been dispersed and changed, or something else? This is where Locke argues "the person" as a separate thing from the animal, physical body. When resurrection comes, the person can have the host of a different body and still be the same person.

Along these lines Locke argues that the human/person distinction is a locus of moral accountability. Locke believed that a person is responsible for acting with virtue throughout time, and should be accountable for actions at all times. Meaning, a person is to be punished only for crimes they can remember... And suddenly we all have amnesia.

### The Animalists

Animalists reject Locke's idea that the person is concept, proposing that it is instead a phase. They claim that personhood is more the state or phase in which a being has the capabilities of things like reasoning, reflection, and rational thought. "In this way, being a person is a matter of what something can _do_, rather than what something _is_."&#x20;

### What is it like to be a bat?

Nagel famously states that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to _be_ that organismâ€”something it is like _for_ the organism" in this paper. Essentially, he claims that consciousness implies an understanding of what it is like to be a particular being. Amongst many other things, Nagel proposes that the mind-brain problem can not be explained with reductionist theories. He believes that a crucial factor in our inability to understand consciousness is simply the existence of the inability of one being to understand what it is like to be another. The bat is used as an example because it is different enough from humans to have a completely different way of perceiving, but it still similar enough for us to entertain the idea that bats have consciousness. Nagel goes on to say that while we can image what it is like to behave like a bat, we can never fully capture the mindset of a bat. While there are things humans don't understand but could with enough time, there may be things that we simply are unable to understand, even with infinite time. He claims that one of these things is what it is like to be a bat, or any other being for that matter. In this way it is sort of a subjectivist argument, similar to that of Descartes: we only really have the ability to know what it is like to be ourselves, even how other humans experience the world is inaccessible, though we can probably get a better picture of what it's like to be another human than a bat. Ultimately Nagel believes that in order to settle the mind-brain problem we must delve into consciousness and what it is. He asserts that in order for a simple reductionist physical argument to be valid, it would be necessary for all being to feel consciousness and experience in the same way, or at least our experience must be determined exclusively by our physical makeup. Nagel doesn't claim this is impossible, he just makes the point that we really can't prove this if we lack the ability to understand what it is like to be something else, like a bat.
