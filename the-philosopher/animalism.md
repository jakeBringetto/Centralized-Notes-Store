# Animalism

### Lockean Legacy

Jonny draws a sharp ahh distinction between the human animal and the person. His idea is that there is the classification of man as an animal - a living, breathing, complex arrangement of matter capable of sustaining life. On the other hand, there is the person, who is able of intelligent thought (however you define that...) -- reason, reflection, knowledge of the self as the self, etc.&#x20;

> as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that _Person_

&#x20;A large motivation for this discussion around the time of Locke is the resurrection problem - On the resurrection day, what gets resurrected, the physical matter of the body that has been dispersed and changed, or something else? This is where Locke argues "the person" as a separate thing from the animal, physical body. When resurrection comes, the person can have the host of a different body and still be the same person.

Along these lines Locke argues that the human/person distinction is a locus of moral accountability. Locke believed that a person is responsible for acting with virtue throughout time, and should be accountable for actions at all times. Meaning, a person is to be punished only for crimes they can remember... And suddenly we all have amnesia.

### The Animalists

Animalists reject Locke's idea that the person is concept, proposing that it is instead a phase. They claim that personhood is more the state or phase in which a being has the capabilities of things like reasoning, reflection, and rational thought. "In this way, being a person is a matter of what something can _do_, rather than what something _is_."&#x20;
