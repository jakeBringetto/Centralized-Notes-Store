# Meditations

### Introduction:

#### Historical/life background:

#### Philosophical background:

_Meditations_ is rooted not only in stoicism, but also the underlying philosophical system at play at the time of the work. Unlike today, philosophy was not purely an academic subject studied by a few, but a subject with practicality, that many studied as a "design for living".  The particular school that Marcus was involved with was the Stoic School.&#x20;

## Summary:

### Book 2:

#### 2.1

"when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly." People behave in these terrible ways because they can't tell good from evil. However, the person that can see good and evil can realize that even those who are evil share the same nature as them, and to hate them or obstruct them or feel anger towards them is unnatural

#### 2.2

"Instead, as if you were dying right now, despise your flesh...stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future."

#### 2.3

Essentially, the nature of the whole dictates everything, and everything that maintains this nature is good. Primarily, this maintenance comes through change.

#### 2.4

"Remember how long you've been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn't use them." We have a limited time on this Earth, and time wasted is time that will never be returned to us.

#### 2.5
